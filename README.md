# Nvim_Config
This is my personal nvim configuration. It maps many keybinds and plugins using vimplug.
This is for MAC only! I use option as my main modifier key, so it will not work in windows or linux
I am not a "good" vim user, meaning I do not use vim how it is designed to be used. If you are new to nvim, don't use this.
